# zef.studio

This is the code and content that generates my personal website at
[zef.studio](https://zef.studio).

It's built in Swift on [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish), with a
whole lot of customization that I did to get things how I want them.

I haven't put much time into documenting these, but let me know if you have any
questions!

The template and design is handcoded by me, and I use the excellent
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com) to generate the CSS.

I also used [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com) for the image gallery that is
activated when an image is selected.
