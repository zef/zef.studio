# The Web I Want to Create

This is my refuge. This is my National Forest.

The web has become so hopelessly polluted.

The ads, the monetization. The cookie pop-ups. The heavy, bloated,
resource-intensive websites. The endless oceans of SEO-driven blog spam. So much
_noise_.

It's revolting to me, and I want none of that.

Less terribly, but still distasteful


So welcome. I hope you like it here, and that you come often.


## How I made this site, and why.

In a web that's saturated with generic Squarespace websites.

In a world where modern and current design trends dictate sans-serif fonts I
chose a serif font.

In a climate of bloated websites that are over reliant on JavaScript and
template frameworks, I handcoded a lightweight website that uses JavaScript for
only the image gallery.
