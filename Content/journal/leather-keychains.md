# Leather Keychains

One of the things I love about making things is that it provides great inspiration for meaningful gifts.

Last year I made a couple small keychains for myself, and I thought they would make a nice small gift that I could give to family and friends.

The leather is treated with neatsfoot oil, which I enjoy using on this bare leather. It significantly darkens the leather.

I cut a bunch of strips of leather out by hand and put some together.

A friend of mine has a large industrial laser cutter, and he had invited me to come over so we could try out cutting leather with it. So I cut out a bunch of the straps with the laser cutter.

I don't love the burnt edge — especially how it feels — but it is certainly quick and convenient.
