# Why I Haven't Been Sharing Things on the Internet

I have often had the intention to share something, but most frequently I end up
not doing so in the end. I've been thinking about why this is, and I'm trying to
identify the reasons that I don't often post things. Here are some.


### I don't share because it takes a lot of time.

I think time has been my largest constraint lately.

It's a particularly busy season of life for me, and life's priorities don't
always line up with desires like writing on my website and sharing. But life is
busy for just about everyone, and I realize that if I want this to happen, I
need to make time for it.

I also know that my perfectionism can lead to things taking a lot longer than
they need to. I want to get better at sharing things more quickly, and without
overthinking it too much. At the same time, I don't want to produce low-quality
and low-effort content.


### I don't share because I don't think anyone will care.

I think this is basically mostly true. But that's ok. [As I initially wrote](/journal/zef-studio):

> I've realized that the answer to the question "who cares?" really doesn't matter
> beyond the fact that _I care_. I want to do this for myself â€” even if nobody
> else reads it.

That said, I hope some people will care. I hope some people will notice.


### I don't share because I am overly concerned with appearances.

A distasteful aspect of some types of social network interactions is when things
feel self-congratulatory or vain.

In some ways, I have a fairly cynical outlook on people's motives in their
social media posts, and I think that this outlook has often discouraged me from
sharing much.

Now, I do not believe these concerns to be completely unwarranted, but I wrote
that I am "overly concerned" because this concern has dissuaded me from sharing
things. This is to my own detriment, and to the detriment of others who might
have otherwise benefited from my work as well.

I desire to find a way to share my work while remaining entirely authentic. I
don't want to worry about showing off or seeking attention to the point where it
prevents me from sharing good things.


### I don't share because I don't have an audience.

The social networks that I (somewhat) participate in currently are Twitter,
Instagram, and Facebook.

My Twitter usage originated in the world of web and software development. The
people that follow me are a mix between people from the software world, and some
personal friends that are completely outside that world. It's also a very small
following.

Regarding Facebook, I reluctantly maintain my account there because of the
nature of personal connections there that I don't want to cut off, but I dislike
the company and many aspects of how Facebook works as a product. I want to share
things there, but I don't see Facebook as a place where I want to "build an
audience", and I'm not sure how many of my friends there will have much interest
in what I'm doing here.

There's obviously a chicken and egg problem with sharing things online. I don't
post because nobody would see it. But if I'm not posting anything, why would
anyone start following me?

[Previously](/journal/what-i-want-from-this-site):

> and helpful communities that they can interact with and learn from as they share
> what they are doing.

I haven't pursued having a community like that in earnest, and while I never
want follower counts to be my goal, I do desire to have the attention of people
who care about the things I do.


### I donâ€™t share because I have a wide range of interests.

Conventional advice is to specialize, to target a niche â€” thatâ€™s how you gain a
following. But I have no interest in doing that. My [goals for this website](/journal/what-i-want-from-this-site)
are not dependent on following conventional advice, gaining a following, or
doing what is considered normal.

Iâ€™m going to do what I am interested in without concerning myself with
questions of audience.

Another thing I've noticed is that exposure to new subjects is sometimes a nice
surpise that can spark a new interest in something that I probably wouldn't be
aware of otherwise. Seeing people share things that are completely unrelated to
the subject for which I started following them has been a fun catalyst to expand
my knowledge and awareness of the world. I hope and trust that some people will
feel similarly about me sharing things from a diverse range of subjects.


### I don't share because I don't want to re-express thoughts that are not original.

I'm not quite sure why I care about this â€”Â why it affects me. But it does.

It's sort of like when you hear a cover of a song that doesn't do anything new.
The same arrangement, tempo, feel. The same flourishes, just trying to
faithfully emulate the original. But who want's to hear that? It will simply
never be as good. What's the point?[1](#footnotes)

I know at some level that when I share what I've learned, it's not just a
meaningless cover. But I have trouble really trusting that.

Part of what I'm averse to is the trite, soulless content that is so commonly
farmed for views and provides little value. But I know I'm not going to just
regurgitate random useless information, and I need to be willing to talk about
things that have already been discussed elsewhere.

Most thought â€”Â even if arrived at independently â€” simply isn't original. There
is nothing new under the sun. But I know that expressing and re-expressing what
has been said before is a natural and essential part in the dissemination of
ideas and knowledge. The original hardly matters. Even if I'm saying something
that seems obvious to me, I should trust that there are people for whom it could
provide value. And who knows? Maybe I can help someone become [one of today's lucky 10,000](https://xkcd.com/1053/).

That gets me wondering though â€”Â _who was the first person to express trepidation
about expressing unoriginal thoughts?_ ðŸ¤”.


### I don't share because I don't want to waste your time and attention.

I believe that attention is the most precious of resources.

There's a deep-seated fear in me that I will be wasting people's time. Though I
endeavor to make what I do worthwhile, I recognize that not everything I do is
going to be relevant or interesting to everyone.

It's hard for me to trust that if someone is following and seeing what I post,
that they _want_ to see it, and that if they don't, then they can deal with that
in whatever way they see fit.

I think part of my fear stems from the way that I personally tend to pay close
attention to those that I follow. And I naturally hope that the kind of people
who follow me will do likewise â€” even though it seems like that's rare these
days.

I've also been getting better at skipping content that isn't worth my time and
attention, and I think that's an important thing for me to be more discerning
about what is worth my time and attention.

With that said, _thank you_ for your attention. I deeply value and appreciate
it.


1) Okay I realize this sounds a little harsh. I've recorded covers like this
before, and I will again. It could be a tribute. Or a test of recording skills.
There are valid reasons. I'm just saying that it doesn't generally add much
value.
