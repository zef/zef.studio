My relationship with the internet has largely been `readonly`, but I’m trying to
change that.

Sharing things on the internet has long been a difficult thing for me. There was
a time when I felt like I didn't share much because I don't have anything to

When I think about, there are a lot of reasons I've identified that I don't

When thinking about the types of things I want to post, I find there is a
tension regarding what I think is worth posting and what isn’t. Even when
thinking about writing this very post I doubt myself. Why should I write the
cliche “my first post” that exists on most blogs, just prior to their probable
abandonment? Who cares? Why would anyone want to read that?

My own insecurities such as these are part of what has inhibited me from

nobody else reads it. With that in mind, I intend to treat it as a personal
journal and archive of some of my projects. Something that will be valuable to
me for years to come, and to look back upon many years into the future. These
goals are served by the method I have chosen to use to setup the site. Perhaps
I will expand on some of these ideas later.

Of course I hope that people will find my projects interesting and useful, but I
know that I

I want to make this a place where I can make a little part of the web that I
wish were more ubiquitous. No ads. Just sharing a small part of my life here
with anyone who might be interested.
