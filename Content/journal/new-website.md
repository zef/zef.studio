# zef.studio

My relationship with the internet has largely been `readonly`, but I’m trying to
change that.

Sharing things on the internet has long been a difficult thing for me. There was
a time when I felt like I didn't share much because I don't have anything to
say, but I realized that that's not really the case. I think it's more that I
don't want to share much on the platforms I had available to me.

Regarding the major social media platforms, they just aren't somewhere I want
to invest my time an energy. I do intend to post links to my website on social
media platforms, but using social media platforms as distribution networks is a
very different thing than using them as a content platform.

I love the open, distributed, personalized web. The web in it's purest,
uncontaminated form. Personal websites epitomize some of the best of what the
web has to offer, and it's long overdue that I pursued having one for myself.

In 2009 I made a website for my software work. My first post started out in a
very similar manner to this one. Lamenting my one-sided relationship with the
internet, and saying that having a website of my own was overdue. Well, what's
different now? I never fully intended to be regularly blogging and writing
there, but I wanted to have a place to share what I was doing. I ended up only
writing a handful of posts over a couple years, and then I stopped really doing
anything on that site at all. I guess I thought that the website would be more
important for me from a career perspective than it was... But as it turned out,
work kept coming and I never even had a client portfolio put together until I
built one for this website.

I want to make this my little corner of the web that that embodies the web that
I wish were more ubiquitous.

No ads. Just sharing a small part of my life with anyone who might be
interested.

## What Will I Post About?

To begin with, I intend to primarily post things that I've been making over the
past few years — woodworking, leatherworking, metalworking, 3d printing,
electronics, repairs, and things I'm learning as I pursue designing and creating
physical objects.

I have a wide range of interests outside of those areas too, and ultimately I
don't know what I will be wanting to share over time, but my goal is that this
would be a place where I don't have to limit myself based on what I think other
people will be be interested in, but to do my own thing and follow my own whims.

I'd also like to share some travel photos, and perhaps share thoughts about
whatever else I feel like sharing, though my intentions in that regard are much
less formed.

When thinking about what to post, I find there is a
tension regarding what I think is worth posting and what isn’t. Even when
thinking about writing this very post I doubt myself. Why should I write the
cliche “my first post” that exists on most blogs, just prior to their probable
abandonment? Who cares? Why would anyone want to read that?

My own insecurities such as these are part of what has inhibited me from
contributing and sharing very much of my work online.

I’ve realized that the answer to the question “who cares?” really doesn't
matter beyond the fact that _I care_. I want to do this for myself, even if
nobody else reads it. With that in mind, I intend to treat it as a personal
journal and archive of some of my projects. Something that will be valuable to
me for years to come, and to look back upon many years into the future. These
goals are served by the way in which I have chosen to use to setup the site.

Of course I hope that people will find my projects and other content interesting
and useful. I hope that people will engage with me.

But I have realized that I want to primarily focus on the intrinsic value that I
will get from the process of what I do here.

Perhaps I will expand on some of these ideas later.

## Continuing These Ideas

As a followup to this post, I intend to expand on some of these ideas in some
upcoming posts, with the tentative titles:

- The Web I Love
- What I Want for This Website
- Why I Haven't Been Sharing Things on the Internet

When I think about writing and sharing online, there are a lot of reasons I've
identified that I don't write,
