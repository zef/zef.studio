My relationship with the internet has largely been `readonly`, but I’m trying to
change that.

Sometimes it feels like there’s just everything available somewhere online. But
I think that’s really quite far from the truth. There is so much information
that is missing from the internet; perhaps it’s there somewhere, but not well
presented, or buried in forum threads, or maybe lost in the black hole of social
media timelines.

I often find myself searching for something that I can't find, and end up doing
some legwork myself to find the answer and solve a problem. I want to do my part
to fill in these gaps as I find them, and I hope that some

When thinking about the types of things I want to post, I find there is a
tension regarding what I think is worth posting and what isn’t. Even when
thinking about writing this very post I doubt myself. Why should I write the
cliche “my first post” that exists on most blogs, just prior to their probable
abandonment? Who cares? Why would anyone want to read that?

My own insecurities such as these are part of what has inhibited me from
contributing and sharing very much of my work online.

I’ve realized that the answer to the question “who cares?” really doesn't
matter beyond the fact that _I care_. I want to do this for myself, even if
nobody else reads it. With that in mind, I intend to treat it as a personal
journal and archive of some of my projects. Something that will be valuable to
me for years to come, and to look back upon many years into the future. These
goals are served by the method I have chosen to use to setup the site. Perhaps
I will expand on some of these ideas later.

Of course I hope that people will find my projects interesting and useful, but I
know that I

I want to make this a place where I can make a little part of the web that I
wish were more ubiquitous. No ads. Just sharing a small part of my life here
with anyone who might be interested.


## How

In a web that's saturated with generic Squarespace websites.

In a world where modern and current design trends dictate sans-serif fonts I
chose a serif font.

In a climate of bloated websites that are over reliant on JavaScript and
template frameworks, I handcoded a lightweight website that uses JavaScript for
only the image gallery.
