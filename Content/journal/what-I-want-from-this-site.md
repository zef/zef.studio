# What I Want for This Website

So I've had this itch to have my own website — a vague picture of what I want to
do with this website. I've put a lot of work into it already now, and as I try
to clarify my intentions, I am asking myself: what do I want to get out of this?

### _I want to play my part in making the internet what I want it to be._

Sometimes it feels like there’s just everything available somewhere online. But
I think that’s really quite far from the truth. There is so much information
that is missing from the internet; perhaps it’s there somewhere, but not well
presented, or buried in forum threads, or maybe lost in the black hole of social
media timelines.

I often find myself searching for something that I can't find, and end up doing
some legwork myself to find the answer and solve a problem. I want to do my part
to fill in these gaps as I find them, and I do hope that others will find them
useful. That's just one category of things that I would like to post, but it's
something I think is important.

### _I want to do my best work for myself._

For years as a freelance software engineer, I have done my best work for my
clients, and largely neglected my own projects, ideas, and online involvement.
This has bothered me for a long time, and I'd like to do a better job of
investing in my own personal work.

It's not that I haven't spent time on my own projects — but for the most part I
have not seen them through to fruition.

I have a hard time sharing work that I'm not proud of, and for me that's a high
bar. I'd like to get over this.

### _I want people to find it inspiring, useful, and educational._

Although I want to do this for its own intrinsic value and the value that I will
derive from the process, I do want others to see and value it.

### _I want to learn._

Writing and sharing is a catalyst for learning. I believe that the process
itself will be a learning experience, but I also have hopes that some of the
learning will happen _after_ publishing, too.

Sharing anything on the internet opens one up to

The internet can be a toxic place, with unbound negativity and nastiness. It can
also be an incredible, helpful place.

I don't really have any kind of audience right now.



### _I want to grow in the practice of writing._

I'm a strong believer in the idea that _writing is thinking_. Writing
articulately is invaluable, and it's something I'd like to spend more time
doing. Putting a thought into writing is not the simple relocation of the idea
from your head to words on a page, but indeed plays a critical role in the
formulation of the thought itself.

In my career, my favorite people to work with are excellent communicators.
Specifically in their written communication. The value of someone who can read
effectively and write with clarity simply cannot be overstated.

It's common for people to just want to "hop on a quick call" in lieu of putting
in the time to read and write to one another. Admittedly, the writing process
_is_ more time consuming than a conversation, but it absolutely pays off.


Given the effort

I suppose I do a decent amount of writing, and I enjoy that. But I haven't been
doing any writing _in public_, and I'd like to.

## What Does Success Look Like?

I will consider this website a success if I can follow through in posting and
improving it.

I will consider this website a failure if end up having spent more time building
the site than I do contributing to it. I've done this a number of times on past
projects. In the early days of my web development career, I built a fairly
full-featured [Content Management
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) and blogging
engine from scratch. This is basically a rite of passage for a new web
developer, and I have no regrets in that regard. The system hosted six different
sites over its lifetime (well, it's still running), and served its purpose
decently. A couple of these sites were for my personal and freelance
websites, and I never utilized them to the extent that I hoped to.

For instance, on the website for my freelance software engineering business, I
spent a long time obsessing over the presentation of blocks of code. I created a
custom color scheme for the code, and I carefully implemented an expansion
animation so that the code block would look excellent and well-aligned within
the borders of the blog post, but would expand to allow users to view the full
horizontal width of the code block. The expansion animation was snappy and
smooth, and the collapse animation was slower, providing a balanced experience.

I used this functionality exactly once on my website for a 16 line code snippet.

Similarly, on the personal website I made for my wife and I, I created only two
posts.
