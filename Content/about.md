![.rounded.trailing Zef Houssney](zef-houssney.jpg)

My name is Zef Houssney. I live in Boulder, Colorado with my wife and four
children.

This website is my personal journal; a place for me to catalog and share my
projects, thoughts, and whatever else is interesting to me. I love building and
making all sorts of things, and that's primarily what I'm sharing on this
website right now.

Professionally, I have been working as a freelance software developer since
2007. I love creating excellent and useful software, especially for iOS, which
has been my primary focus for most of my career. I have also worked
professionally as a full-stack web developer, mainly building web applications
with Ruby on Rails.

Some of the iOS software I've created for clients is in my [iOS Development
Portfolio](/portfolio).

<h3 class="centered">Technical Details</h3>

This website is written in [Swift](https://swift.org) and generated as a static
site using [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish), with a number of
customizations I implemented to get the behavior I wanted.
I designed and handcoded the template, and use the excellent
[Sass language](https://sass-lang.com) to generate the CSS.
The code for this website is [open-source](https://github.com/zef/zef.studio).
