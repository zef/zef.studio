# Duffel Bags

Here are some simple duffel bags I made for my family.

I documented the process of sewing one of these on [this Instagram story](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17922903128925067/),
so check that out if you're interested.

I don't have too many details in this post, but I'd like to write up more about
making these in the future, and produce an in-depth video about it.

I like to call this design the "Dead-Simple Duffel" because it's about as simple
as you can get, as it's just a cylinder with a zipper and straps.

I love the materials and the simplicity of the design. The fabric is Cordura
500D nylon, with an 8mm matte-black water-resistant zipper. I used 1" webbing for
most of these, but the two-tone bag has 3/4" instead because I didn't have any
1" in that color.

After making the grey/charcoal bags, I added some end-straps across the cylinder end,
which I like a lot.

I hand-cut the pattern for the first couple I made, but laser-cut out some more
on a friend's industrial CO2 laser. I still have some blanks to make more.
