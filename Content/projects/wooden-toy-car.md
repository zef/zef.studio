# Wooden Toy Car


I made this wooden car for my eldest son's 6th birthday. My 8 year old daughter
worked on it with me and we gave it to him together as a gift from both of us.

I love making things with my kids and giving them a chance to get involved in
the process. My daughter and I decided together what to make and chose the style
of car body we wanted to emulate. We discussed the elements of design and how we
would go about making it happen, and she helped physically with some hand
sanding.

I started out by cutting some wheels out of some pine with a hole saw. I
eyeballed the size of wheel I thought would look nice, and basically formed the
scale of the car based on the wheels.

Then I found a profile of a "vintage car", which ended up being some generic stock photo
that does not actually say what kind of car it is, but I think it seems to most
closely resemble the [Toyota 2000GT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_2000GT).

I used my architect's ruler to roughly scale my drawing based on the digital
one, but I wasn't too concerned with accuracy. The image was more about
inspiration, and we took some liberties and shaped it as we saw fit.

I had initially thought about making a few matching pieces and then gluing them
together, thinking that it would be easier to sand and shape them before they
were too thick. So after cutting out my first piece on the bandsaw
and sanding it to the shape that I wanted, I cut and template routed a second
piece to match. But then, we had the idea to use some
[padauk](https://www.wood-database.com/african-padauk/)
strips I had to add some color and interest between the layers. I decided to
glue this up as a solid block, so I ended up not needing the second piece.

After gluing up the block of wood, I traced out the shape, cut it out on the
band saw, and sanded everything smooth. I used my drill press with a 1.75"
forstner bit to drill out the wheel wells, and then followed up with a 3/8" bit
to create the hole for the axles to fit inside. Then I smoothed and shaped the
transition between the wheel wells and the body with files and sand paper.

I used some 3/8" oak dowel for the axles, and glued on some pine blanks I cut
out with a smaller hole saw to cap them off. It was easiest to round off and
shape these blanks after gluing them to the axles. This is definitely the weak
point of the entire thing, and I knew it would be when I did it. Still, I didn't
feel like I had a good alternative with the time and resources I had available.

Before gluing the axles in, I put a wax and oil finish on the contact points
between the axles and the wheels, trying to make sure they would spin freely
enough after assembly. Then I glued them in to the body. I also put the finish
on the rest of the wood.

The axle caps have come off a number of times, so I've had it back in the shop
to fix up the axles on multiple occasions in the last two years since I built
it. My son has also played with it pretty aggressively, so that's pretty much to
be expected.

The car measures about 2.5" wide, and 11" long.

A fun little project! I'm pretty happy with how it turned out — though it's not
perfect. I like the look of the pine with the padauk, which I'm guessing is a
fairly rare combination. The car has been well loved and well used. Pine isn't
the sturdiest of woods for a toy that needs to take some abuse, but I don't mind
it getting dinged up, so long as it's being enjoyed.
