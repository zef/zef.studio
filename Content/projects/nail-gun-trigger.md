# Plywood Nail Gun Trigger

I borrowed a nail gun from a friend to help me build my deck.

The trigger was missing, and I had initially thought I could just make it work
without, but it was pretty difficult to do so — especially firing the nail at
the correct time.

I decided to spend a few minutes trying to make one out of plywood.

## Thoughts on 3D Printing

I've shared some [3D printing](/tags/3d-printing/) repair projects recently, and
I have more on the way. It's tempting to jump to the idea of 3D printing for all
kinds of repairs if you have a printer. However, if you have a bandsaw and
sanding capabilities, 3D printing is often no substitute in terms of quick
prototyping.

Modeling, printing, testing, and iterating on something like this with 3D
printing can be time consuming and wasteful — especially if you have no
reference part, which I don't.

I love how [Matthias Wandel](https://www.woodgears.ca) expressed this in the
excerpt embedded here:

One benefit of doing this with 3D printing, however, is that the model can be
shared, so sharing a model online can help other people save time, money, and
can help rescue broken things, too. If I had a broken reference part, I probably
would have been more likely to make a model and share it.
