# The Great Gift

The institute of gift giving can be loathsome to me at times.


## The Expectation

For me, the simple expectation of gift giving robs the act of some of its intended joy.

This occurs on both sides. As a giver, I don't like the expectation that I'm supposed to give a gift, and that not doing so represents some sort of failure; that it represents a lack of care or love for them.

Likewise, as a receiver, I don't want others to feel some sort of obligation to give me a gift on my birthday or Christmas.
