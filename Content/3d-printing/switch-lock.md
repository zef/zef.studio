# Switch Lock

I have a switch in my utility room that shuts off my heating system. It's been
turned off accidentally a couple times, so I printed a switch lock that prevents
accidental switching, but still allows it to be turned off if needed.

I haven't used supports much in the past. I used the "paint-on supports" feature
to add a small removable support just at the tip of the arm that will block the
switch, as that arm is floating in the air.
